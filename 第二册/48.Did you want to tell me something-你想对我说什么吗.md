## Do you want to tell me something

### Dentists always ask questions when it is impossible for you to answer.My dentist had just pulled out one of my teenth and had told me to rest for a while.I tried to say something, but my mouth was full of cotton-wool.He knew I collected birds'egg and asked me whether my collection was growing.He then asked me how my brother was and whether i liked my new job in London.In answer to these question I either nodded or made noises.Meanwhile, my tongue was busy searching out the hole where the tooth had been .I suddenly felt very worried,but cloud not say anything.When the dentist at last removed the cotton-wool form my mouth , I was able to tell him that he had pulled out the wrong tooth.
