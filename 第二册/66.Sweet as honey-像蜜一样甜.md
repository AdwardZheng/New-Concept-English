## Sweet as honey

### The Hatheld Puffin is a modern areo-plane, but its designer, Mr John Wimpenny, is finding it diffcult to get it off the ground. The reason for this is that this plane is also a bicycle.Its pilot has to pedal hard to get it into the air.After Mr Wimpenny had the plane built,it was tested thoroughly.In 1961, it was the first man-powered aircraft to fly half a mile.While being flown by a champion amateur cyclist in 1963, the plane crashed on an airfield.Since then, Mr Wimpeeny has had it rebuilt.He has had the length of the wings increased so that they now measyre 93 feet almost as long as those of a Dakota.Many people have shown interest this new and unusual sport.But through air cyclists may learn  how to fly over short distance and may, eventually, even get across the English Channel, it is doubtful weather they will ever cycle across the Atlantic.
